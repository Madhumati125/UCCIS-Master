# UCCIS — REVIEW PACKET SUBMISSION 7

## Deterministic Urban Intelligence + Replay Memory + TANTRA Convergence

---

# 1. ENTRY POINT

System Entry:
Frontend Dashboard (React - Vite)

User Interaction Trigger:

- Run All Zones Button
- Zone Hover Event
- Map Interaction Event

Initial Source:
Mock / Backend Zone Dataset

Entry Path:
UI → Dashboard.jsx → Intelligence Engine → Execution Log → State Memory

---

# 2. CORE EXECUTION FLOW

Zones are processed through deterministic pipeline:

1. Load zone dataset
2. Apply weighted risk computation
3. Derive current state (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
4. Generate timestamped output
5. Store execution result in memory layer
6. Push to Execution Log UI

Flow:

Zones → Risk Engine → State Classifier → Log Generator → UI Renderer

---

# 3. LIVE FLOW

### (Real Data → Signal → Intelligence → Governance Request)

1. Real Data:
   Zone metrics (traffic, water, waste, complaints)

2. Signal Layer:
   Structured zone signal normalization

3. Intelligence Layer:
   Weighted scoring + state classification

4. Governance Request:
   Batch execution output on "Run All Zones"

Example Flow:

Zone Data → Risk Score → State → Audit Log → UI Update

---

# 4. REAL JSON OUTPUT

```json
[
  {
    "zone_id": "ZONE_1",
    "risk_score": 78,
    "current_state": "HIGH",
    "timestamp": "10:21:05"
  },
  {
    "zone_id": "ZONE_2",
    "risk_score": 35,
    "current_state": "LOW",
    "timestamp": "10:21:05"
  }
]
5. DETERMINISTIC FORMULA EXPLANATION

Risk score is computed using weighted sum:

risk_score =
(traffic_weight × traffic_score) +
(water_weight × water_score) +
(flood_weight × flood_score) +
(waste_weight × waste_score) +
(complaint_weight × complaint_score)

Rules:

Output normalized to 0–100
No randomness allowed
Same input always produces same output
Fixed precision rounding

State Classification:

0–40 → LOW
41–70 → MEDIUM
71–100 → HIGH
6. MEMORY + REPLAY FLOW

System maintains replayable intelligence history:

Stored Fields:

zone_id
risk_score
current_state
timestamp

Memory Layers:

/memory
/snapshots
/state_history

Capabilities:

replay execution cycles
compare historical vs current state
trace evolution of zones

Example Transition:
LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH

7. FAILURE CASES

Handled Scenarios:

1. Missing Zone Data

Response:
{
"status": "error",
"error_code": "INVALID_SCHEMA"
}

2. Duplicate Execution Trigger
Prevent repeated logs on same cycle
Only state-change triggers execution
3. Stale Signal
Ignore outdated zone data
Mark as "SKIPPED"
4. Schema Mismatch
Reject malformed inputs
Return structured error response
8. PROOF

System Validation Evidence:

Execution Log shows batch processing
Zone state changes are deterministic
No duplicate execution entries
UI reflects real-time updates
Replay memory stores structured history

Example Log Output:

ZONE_1 → 78 → HIGH → 10:21:05
ZONE_2 → 35 → LOW → 10:21:05

9. TANTRA ALIGNMENT STATUS

Status: ✅ FULLY ALIGNED

Alignment Checks:

✔ Deterministic computation enforced
✔ No random state transitions
✔ Replayable memory implemented
✔ Governance-controlled execution flow
✔ Structured signal → intelligence pipeline
✔ Trace-safe execution design

Final Verdict:

UCCIS has transitioned into a:
→ Deterministic Urban Intelligence System
→ Replayable State Machine Architecture
→ Governance-safe execution framework
```
